Questanoid
=========================================

Questanoid is a VR clone of the Pong/Arkanoid games, for the Oculus Quest.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

See https://github.com/arigo/Questanoid/releases.  Drop the downloaded .apk file on the SideQuest window to install (https://sidequestvr.com/).


INSTALLATION IN UNITY
---------------------

To use the source code, you need first to have Unity 2019.1.14f1 (any other version from 2019 onwards is probably compatible too).  Grab it from https://unity.com/ .  Make sure you install the dependencies for VR on Quest.

Clone this repo, and go to that directory and open it with Unity (launch Unity, click "Add", pick that directory).

You need to install the asset "Oculus integration", which is not included in this repo.
